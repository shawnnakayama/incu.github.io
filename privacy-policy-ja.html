<p><strong>Overview:</strong> This document summarizes the INCU Consulting LLC (the “Firm” or “INCU”)’s comprehensive written information security program (the “Program”) mandated by the Federal Trade Commission’s Safeguards Rule and the Gramm – Leach – Bliley Act (“GLBA”). In particular, this document describes elements of the Program pursuant to which the Firm intends to (i) ensure the security and confidentiality of covered information, (ii) protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security of such information, and (iii) protect against the unauthorized access or use of such information in ways that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to clients. The Program incorporates by reference the Firm’s policies and procedures enumerated below and is in addition to any institutional policies and procedures that may be required pursuant to other federal and state laws and regulations.</p>

<h3>Designation of Representatives:</h3>
<p>INCU’s Principal Member is designated as the Program Officer who shall be responsible for coordinating and overseeing the Program. The Program Officer may designate other representatives of the Firm to oversee and coordinate specific elements of the Program. Any questions regarding the implementation of the Program or the interpretation of this document should be directed to the Program Officer or his or her designees.</p>

<h3>Scope of Program:</h3>
<p>The Program applies to any record containing nonpublic financial or personal identifiable information about clients, formal clients or other third parties who have a relationship with the Firm, whether in paper, electronic or other forms, that is handled or maintained by or on behalf of the Firm or its affiliates. For these purposes, the term “nonpublic financial and personal identifiable information” shall mean any information (i) provided by clients, formal clients or other third parties in order to obtain a service from the Firm, (ii) about clients, formal clients or other third parties resulting from any transaction with the Firm involving a service, or (iii) otherwise obtained about clients, formal clients or other third parties in connection with providing a service to the parties.</p>

<h3>Elements of the Program:</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Risk Identification and Assessment.</strong> The Firm intends, as part of the Program, to undertake to identify and assess external and internal risks to the security, confidentiality, and integrity of nonpublic financial information that could result in the unauthorized disclosure, misuse, alteration, destruction or other compromise of such information. By implementing the Program, the Program Officer will establish procedures for identifying and assessing such risks in each relevant area of the Firm’s operations, including:</li>
  <ul style="margin-left:2em"><i>Employee training and management.</i> The Program Officer will coordinate with the Firm’s relevant personnel to evaluate the effectiveness of the Firm’s procedures and practices relating to access to and use of client records. This evaluation willinclude assessing the effectiveness of the Firm’s current policies and procedures in this area.</ul>
  <ul style="margin-left:2em; padding-bottom: 0;"><i>Information Systems and Information Processing and Disposal.</i> The Program Officer will coordinate with the Firm’s other personnel to assess the risks to nonpublic personal identifiable information associated with the Firm’s information systems, including network and software design, information processing, and the storage, transmission and disposal of nonpublic personal identifiable information. This evaluation will include assessing the Firm’s current policies and procedures relating to Acceptable Use of the Firm’s network and network security, document retention and destruction. The Program Officer will also coordinate with the Firm’s relevant personnel to assess procedures for monitoring potential information security threats associated with software systems and for updating such systems by, among other things, implementing patches or other software fixes designed to deal with known security flaws.</ul>
  <ul style="margin-left:2em; padding-bottom: 0;"><i>Detecting, Preventing and Responding to Attacks.</i> The Program Officer will coordinate with the Firm’s relevant personnel to evaluate procedures for and methods of detecting, preventing and responding to attacks or other system failures and existing network access and security policies and procedures, as well as procedures for coordinating responses to network attacks and developing incident response teams and policies. In this regard, the Program Officer may elect to delegate to a relevant personnel the responsibility for monitoring and participating in the dissemination of information related to the reporting of known security attacks and other threats to the integrity of networks utilized by the Firm.</ul>
<li><strong>Designing and Implementing Safeguards.</strong> The risk assessment and analysis described above shall apply to all methods of handling or disposing of nonpublic financial information, whether in electronic, paper, or other forms. The Program Officer will, on a regular basis, implement safeguards to control the risks identified through such assessments and to regularly test or otherwise monitor the effectiveness of such safeguards. Such testing and monitoring may be accomplished through existing network monitoring and problem escalation procedures.</li>
<li><strong>Overseeing Service Providers.</strong> The Program Officer shall coordinate with those responsible for the third party service procurement activities among the relevant personnel and other affected departments to raise awareness of, and to institute methods for, selecting and retaining only those service providers that are capable of maintaining appropriate safeguards for nonpublic financial and personal identifiable information and other third parties to which they will have access. In addition, the Program Officer will work with the relevant personnel to develop and incorporate standard, contractual protections applicable to third party service providers, which will require such providers to implement and maintain appropriate safeguards. Any deviation from these standard provisions will require the approval of the relevant personnel. These standards shall apply to all existing and future contracts entered with third-party service providers.</li>
<li><strong>Adjustments to Program.</strong> The Program Officer is responsible for evaluating and adjusting the Program based on the risk identification and assessment activities undertaken pursuant to the Program, as well as any material changes to the Firm’s operations or other circumstances that may have a material impact on the Program.</li>
